This directory contains the source files for the LIST100 utility.  This
support utility for the Century model is used to create ASCII output files
from the binary output file.  To build the list100 executable type the
command:
     list100.Make
at the UNIX system prompt.  When you have successfully built the list100 
utility copy or move the executable into the directory from which you will
be running your Century simulations.  The directory from which you will
be running your Century simulations should also contain the following
files:
     century
     event100
     file100
     The parameter files:
          crop.100
          cult.100
          fert.100
          fire.100
          fix.100
          graz.100
          harv.100
          irri.100
          omad.100
          tree.100
          trem.100
          <site>.100   <- your site specific parameter file
          *.sch        <- your schedule file for the simulation
          *.wth        <- optional, a historical weather data
                          file for the site
          crop.def
          cult.def
          fert.def
          fire.def
          fix.def
          graz.def
          harv.def
          irri.def
          omad.def
          site.def
          tree.def

List100 is a utility used to read model output from a binary file
and allow the user to specify which variables should be written
to an ASCII .lis file.

Running List100:

List100 runs in either interactive mode or via command line arguments.

To run with command line arguments, enter:
     list100 binaryname asciiname varlistname starttime endtime
where:
     list100     - name of the executable program
     binaryname  - name of the binary input file, without the '.bin' extension
     ascciname   - name of the ascii output file, without the '.lis' extension
     varlistname - name of the ascii file containing the list of variables to
                   output, with one variable, including subscripts, on each
                   line
     starttime   - starting time, in real format, may be omitted to begin at
                   time binary file begins (if starttime is omitted, endtime
                   must also be omitted)
     endtime     - ending time, in real format, may be omitted to end at time
                   binary file end

To run interactively, enter:
     list100
and answer each question as directed.
