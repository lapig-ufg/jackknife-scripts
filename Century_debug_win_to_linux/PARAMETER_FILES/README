This directory contains sample parameter files that you can use to help you
get Century up and running.  Please send an e-mail message to the address
listed above to report any problems or to ask questions about the Century
model.


Parameter files:

crop.100 - crops
cult.100 - cultivation events
fert.100 - fertilization events
fire.100 - fire events
fix.100  - fixed parameters for a subhumid grassland
graz.100 - grazing events
harv.100 - harvest events 
irri.100 - irrigation events
omad.100 - organic matter addition events
tree.100 - trees
trem.100 - tree removal events


There are biome specific fix.100 files.  These files differ primarily in the
FWLOSS(x) parameters that adjust the relative impact of a PET equation 
originally developed for the tropics.  Select the appropriate fix file for
your site from the list below and copy it to "fix.100" before running your
simulation.  When simulating a savanna use the fix file that corresopnds to
the grass component of your system.

arcfix.100   - arctic tundra
borfix.100   - boreal forest
dryffix.100  - dry forest
drygfix.100  - dry grassland
drytrpfi.100 - dry tropical
ffix.100     - forest
gfix.100     - mesic/subhumid grassland
trpfix.100   - tropical


Also included are several site files.  The values in these files are
based on information gathered at LTER sites.  For more information
about the LTER (Long-Term Ecological Research) program or the individual
sites please access the LTER homepage - http://lternet.edu

aridsl.100 - Jornada Experimental Range, hot desert
boreal.100 - Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest, boreal forest
c3grs.100  - Shortgrass Steppe, shortgrass steppe (formerly called Central
	     Plains Experimental Range)
c4grs.100  - Konza Prairie Research Natural Area, tallgrass prairie
tconif.100 - H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, temperate coniferous forest
tdecid.100 - Cowetta Hydrologic Lab, eastern deciduous forest
tropeg.100 - Luquillo Experimental Forest, tropical rainforest
tsavan.100 - Konza Prairie Research Natural Area, tallgrass prairie
tundra.100 - Niwot Ridge/Green Lake Valley, alpine tundra


And sample schedule files:

aridsl.sch - northern hemisphere arid shrubland
boreal.sch - boreal forest
c3grs.sch  - northern hemisphere c3 dominated
c4grs.sch  - northern hemisphere c4 dominated
tconif.sch - temperate mixed forest
