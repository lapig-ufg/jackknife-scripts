aufert          key for automatic fertilization
                aufert = 0:     no automatic fertilization
                aufert < 1.0:   automatic fertilizer may be applied to 
                		remove some nutrient
                                stress without increasing nutrient concentration
                                above the minimum level; the value of aufert is
                                the fraction of potential C production 
                                (temperature and moisture limited) which will 
                                be maintained
                aufert > 1.0:   automatic fertilizer may be applied to remove 
                		nutrient stress and increase nutrient 
                		concentrations above the minimum level; a value 
                		of aufert between 1.0 and 2.0 determines the 
                		extent to which nutrient concentration is 
                		maintained between the minimum and maximum 
                		levels
                aufert = 2.0    automatic fertilizer may be applied to remove 
                		nutrient stress and increase nutrient 
                		concentrations to the maximum level
		Range: 0 to 2
